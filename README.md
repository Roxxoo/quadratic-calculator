"# quadratic-calculator" 

main file contains code. Code utilizes cmath library to process and display the square root of the equation. At first I imported the math library but it shows a math domain error since the result of the equation is too complex for the math library to process.

If ever someone is going to download this for whatever reason, i recommend changing the data type of variables a,b, and c to float

This script also contains a procedure for the 4 basic arthimetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication)
